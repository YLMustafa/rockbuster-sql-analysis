# rockbuster-sql-analysis
SQL queries for the Rockbuster Stealth data analysis project. Includes scripts to load, clean, and analyse data in a relational database, answering key business questions on revenue, customer demographics, and geographic trends for the company’s digital shift.

## Rockbuster SQL Analysis
This repository contains SQL scripts used for the Rockbuster Stealth data analysis project. As part of the Business Intelligence team, the goal was to analyse Rockbuster’s historical data to support their transition into the online video rental market.

### Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a former global movie rental company. To remain competitive against services like Netflix and Amazon Prime, the company is launching an online streaming platform. This project supports that strategic shift by analysing customer and sales data through SQL to answer key business questions posed by the management team.

### Key Questions Addressed
- Which movies contributed the most or least to revenue?
- What is the average rental duration for all videos?
- Where are Rockbuster’s customers based?
- Which regions contain customers with high lifetime value?
- Do sales figures vary by geographic region?

- ### Dataset Information
- The dataset includes information on:

- Customers
- Payments
- Rental history
- Film inventory
- Geographic locations

It was provided as part of the Rockbuster Stealth case study project and loaded into a PostgreSQL relational database system. The full dataset is approximately 3MB and contains multiple interrelated tables.

### Tools Used
- **PostgreSQL** – for data querying and analysis  
- **Tableau** – to create interactive charts and visualisations  
- **PowerPoint** – to compile final findings into a presentation for stakeholders  
- **SQL** – including JOINs, CTEs, subqueries, and aggregation functions
