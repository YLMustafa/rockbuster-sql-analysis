01. Top 5 Customers Based in Each Country.sql 
-- Step 1: Define CTE to calculate the top 5 customers by total amount paid
WITH top_5_customers AS (
  SELECT 
    B.customer_id, 
    E.country,
    SUM(A.amount) AS total_payment
  FROM payment A
  INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
  INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
  INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
  INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
  WHERE D.city IN (
    'Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule', 
    'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo'
  )
  AND E.country IN (
    'India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 
    'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia'
  )
  GROUP BY B.customer_id, E.country
  ORDER BY total_payment DESC
  LIMIT 5
),

-- Step 2: Define CTE to count all and top 5 customers per country
top_customers AS (
  SELECT 
    D.country, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT top_5.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
  FROM customer A
  INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
  INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
  INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
  LEFT JOIN top_5_customers top_5 ON A.customer_id = top_5.customer_id
  GROUP BY D.country
)

-- Step 3: Output the result
SELECT *
FROM top_customers
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC;
