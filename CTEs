01. Top 5 Customers Based in Each Country

- Task: Analyse top 5 highest-paying customers from the top 10 cities across top 10 countries
-- Purpose: 
--   1. To calculate the average amount paid by the top 5 customers.
--   2. To assess how these high-value customers are distributed across countries.
-- Approach:
--   - Use a CTE (top_5_customers) to retrieve the top 5 customers by total payment amount.
--   - Use a second CTE (top_customers) to:
--       - Count the total number of customers per country.
--       - Count how many of the top 5 customers fall within each country.
--   - Final SELECT returns a comparison of total customers vs. top customers per country.

-- Step 1: Define CTE to calculate the top 5 customers by total amount paid
WITH top_5_customers AS (
  SELECT 
    B.customer_id, 
    E.country,
    SUM(A.amount) AS total_payment
  FROM payment A
  INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
  INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
  INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
  INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
  WHERE D.city IN (
    'Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule', 
    'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo'
  )
  AND E.country IN (
    'India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 
    'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia'
  )
  GROUP BY B.customer_id, E.country
  ORDER BY total_payment DESC
  LIMIT 5
),

-- Step 2: Define CTE to count all and top 5 customers per country

top_customers AS (
  SELECT 
    D.country, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT top_5.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
  FROM customer A
  INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
  INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
  INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
  LEFT JOIN top_5_customers top_5 ON A.customer_id = top_5.customer_id
  GROUP BY D.country
)

-- Step 3: Output the result

SELECT *
FROM top_customers
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC;
