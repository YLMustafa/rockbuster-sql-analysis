01. Average Payment Top Customers.sql
-- Task: Calculate the average amount paid by the top 5 customers from the top 10 cities
-- Purpose: To analyse spending behaviour of the highest-paying customers in high-density customer regions
-- Approach:
--   - Use a subquery to retrieve the top 5 customers by total payment (based on cities from a previous analysis)
--   - Wrap the subquery and compute the average of those total payments

SELECT 
  AVG(total_payment) AS average_total_payment
FROM (
  SELECT 
    B.customer_id, 
    B.first_name AS customer_first_name, 
    B.last_name AS customer_last_name, 
    D.city, 
    E.country, 
    SUM(A.amount) AS total_payment
  FROM payment A
  INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
  INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
  INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
  INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
  WHERE D.city IN (
    'Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule', 
    'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo'
  )
  AND E.country IN (
    'India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 
    'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia'
  )
  GROUP BY 
    B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
  ORDER BY 
    total_payment DESC
  LIMIT 5
) AS total_amount_paid;

02. Top Customers by Country.sql
-- Task: Find how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country
-- Output:
--   - country: the name of the country
--   - all_customer_count: total number of customers per country
--   - top_customer_count: number of top 5 customers per country

INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
